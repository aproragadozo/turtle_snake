# turtle_snake
Object oriented Python noodling.

## Planned Features
* temporary power-ups
  * make snake not die when colliding with walls (this is the default right now, needs to change when feature complete)
  * speed up snake
  * slow down snake
  * background flashes distractingly
* snake starts out not as white cells but as three digits of π (its head is 3, with 14 dangling behind it), snake food is always the next-in-line number of π, and when the snake eats the food, the digit shows up at the end
* pause key combination
